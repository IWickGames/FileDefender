# FileDefender (OutDated - Read Comment)
 Outdated - This version has been arcived and a new one is coming out soon with new features. See the Discord for more information or look down below for a short comment about whats being added.

 An OpenSource Anti-Ransomware Tool

Look in Output and the FileDefender.exe for the prebuilt installer

Note: This is still in development and can cause problems. Also the console window will remain shown untill I can say that this program wont break the system. Also this should not be run on a real system yet as it is not 100% stable yet.

# New Version Updated(Whats coming?)
A update to FileDefender is coming out soon on first the Discord then GitHub as the program still has to past testing on the discord channel. If you want more information and some sneek peeks showing the development make sure to join the Discord. But TL:DR here is whats planned.
1.) Real time Process checking and termination if they dont fit the requirements
2.) Improved the file check time. It should be a lot faster
3.) Automated Error Reporting that sends errors to my server so I can fix errors that show up without you having to sweat
4.) Many stabibility improvements
5.) Mutch more!

Make sure to watch this GitHub or join the Discord as I will push an update when this comes out. Also you can join the Discord if you want to help early testing and you know what your doing(if you don't know how to test ransomware safly please don't do it).

Thanks everyone for the support on this project. Im also thinking of making a donation link or a payed version to help support development and allow me to keep updating this GitHub.

# FileDefender (OutDated - An Update will be out soon whenever it can get past testing)
 An OpenSource Anti-Ransomware Tool

Look in Output and the FileDefender.exe for the prebuilt installer

Note: This is still in development and can cause problems. Also the console window will remain shown untill I can say that this program wont break the system. Also this should not be run on a real system yet as it is not 100% stable yet.
